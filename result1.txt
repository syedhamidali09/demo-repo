Instructions: below you can find a list of steps you are requested to follow using a shell and issuing the appropriate git commands. You are requested to write down those same commands within this text file just after each instruction item. This will help you by keeping track what you did and for discussing with tutors. This file is a helpful place where to store your comments and notes about the exercise.

Run the 'git' command and read carefully the output. It is quick way to revise some of the contents of the lecture.

Ask git about what it knows of the current directory. Hint: in git terminology this is called “status”. It is expected that git knows nothing about the current directory. Isn't it?

It is time to introduce yourself to git. Set the global git variables “user.name” and “user.email” according your personal information. Hint: check out the slides of the lecture.

Verify that git has correctly stored your name and email. Hint: read “git help config” to find out the way to get them.

Create a proper directory where you want to host a simple project named “kindergarten”. The current directory (e.g., home) is usually fine but you could want a more meaningful place. Then move into the directory you created. Just remember that all files and directories in /tmp/ are thrown away at each reboot.

Create a new git repository within the current directory.

Verify that you have a brand new ”.git/” directory full of interesting things.

Ask git about the status and check out what changed with respect the last time you issued that command.

Create a file named hello.py that prints some salutation (unexpected uh?)

Ask git about the status and check out what changed with respect the last time you issued that command.

Put hello.py in the staging area.
